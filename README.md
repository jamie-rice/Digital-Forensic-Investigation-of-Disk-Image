# Digital-Forensic-Investigation-of-Disk-Image


Project Description

This project involved a mock digital forensic investigation of a suspect, 'John Doe.' As part of this coursework, we were tasked with 'seizing' John Doe's computer and conducting a comprehensive analysis. The focus was on digital forensics, and we analysed an imaged file representing John Doe's machine. Although we learned the process using physical hard drives, the imaged file was provided for this exercise.
